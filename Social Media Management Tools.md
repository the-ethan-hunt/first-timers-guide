# What are Social Media Management Tools? 
These are pieces of software that can help streamline and simplify the workflow of community managers, allowing them to publish the same post on different social media. When dealing with multiple accounts or dozens or posts per day, it's critical to use these tools instead of the regular interface of the social media platforms, in order to save time, avoid mistakes and uniformise content.

Social Media Management Tools have different pricing tiers, driven by the amount of features and integration with different social media platforms. These can vary from US$50 per month for basic plans with one user and support for a limited amount of platforms at the same time, to the tune of thousands of dollars for enterprise grade tools that support entire company departments as users.

## Primary tasks of Social Media Management Tools:
1. Posting on multiple platforms
2. Scheduling and manual or automated resharing
3. Adding copy variants for different platforms
4. Shared calendar among managers and editors
5. Analytics and reports
6. Inbox management

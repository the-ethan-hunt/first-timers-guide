Contributing is awesome! :tada:

There will always be rules regarding contributions set by open-source projects, such as those regarding how to make appropriate pull requests.
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` (this file here!) is where you normally find these sets of contributing rules and regulations.

Big projects often have a large number of contributing rules and regulations. However, since this project is targeted for newcomers to open-source,
we will have as few rules as possible. :pizza:

- Write your guide in only Markdown format.
- Place your guide in an appropriate folder. Generally, the name of the folder can be the label tag of the corresponding issue itself.
- Feel free to write an article about topic not listed in the current open issues
- When making a PR (pull request), mention the issue you are solving and/or the name of the article.
- The maintainer will review your PR within 2 days max. **Don't review other contributors' PRs until said so by the maintainer
himself**.

**HAPPY CONTRIBUTING** :smile:

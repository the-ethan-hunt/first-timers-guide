Style of a code

Styling your code is important as it solves a number of problems :-

1 it makes the code readable
2 it makes the code easy to debug
3 it makes the code neat and clean
What you have to do?
=> styling a code means :-
1 intending it properly (the alignment should be proper)
2 give proper spacing b/w lines of code
3 add comments if you need it.
Here are some examples : -
if (x > 0)
{
    printf("x is positive\n");
}
else if (x < 0)
{
    printf("x is negative\n");
}
else
{
    printf("x is zero\n");
}


Declare a switch as follows:

switch (n)
{
    case -1:
        printf("n is -1\n");
        break;

    case 1:
        printf("n is 1\n");
        break;

    default:
        printf("n is neither -1 nor 1\n");
        break;
}

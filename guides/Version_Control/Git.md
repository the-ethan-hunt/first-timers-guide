# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source version control system. It tracks changes to specific versions of code so that previous versions can be recalled and reinstated at a later date. It also makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same files without the risk of overwriting othersâ€™ work or losing files.

Git runs at the command line or through a git interface on your local machine. It keeps track of and maintains files in something called a ***repository*** or ***repo***. A key feature of Git is the ability to make branches. A ***branch*** is a separate copy of the source code that allows a user to try new features and implement code without directly affecting the master branch. When a branch has successfully implemented a revision, it can be ***merged*** back into the master branch. The revision is then officially a part of the original project.

This is the basic structure of a project that uses Git for version control:
* **Working Directory**: This is where you see all your files that can be modified and changed. Once you have made those changes, you can `git add` into the staging area.

* **Staging Area**: Think of this step as the loading dock for your code. You add files that have been changed to this step and ship them off with a commit into the local repository. 

* **Local Repository**: Location on your local machine where your code is hosted.

* **Remote repository**: Remote location your repository is being hosted, typically a remote host such as GitHub.


# Basic Git Commands

* `git init`: Create a new local repository
* `git clone <path to repo>`: Copy a remote repository on to your local machine.
* `git checkout -b <new branch name>`: Create a new branch to make changes that won't affect the master branch.
* `git add` or `git add <file name>`: Add a files or files into staging.
* `git commit -m "commit message"`: All files that have been staged, will be applied to the head of the local repository.
* `git status`: List the files that have been changed and the files that are ready to be staged/commited.
* `git push` and `git push origin <branch name>`: Push will send all commited changes to the repository. By adding the "origin" option, you will send the changes to your remote repository.
* `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes made on the remote repo to your working directory.

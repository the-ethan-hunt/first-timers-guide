# You've finished your project, but, how do you share it?

## The problem

You might ask yourself.. There's gotta be a place where I can host my website for free. <br>
Where do all these other people host their projects? <br>
Other people's projects are visible on the internet, not only from localhost!! <br>

## The solution

Websites such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Render](https://render.com/) are great for hosting your website, for free, forever! (Or at least until they aren't shut down haha)

In the article we will go through the process of hosting a site on <b>Render</b>.
As it is very straightforward.

## Implementing the solution

1. Visit [Render](https://render.com/) in the top right corner click on <b>dashboard</b>.
2. Register an account using your preferred method.(You'll be redirected to the dashboard automatically)
3. In the top right corner, click on the purple `New +` button.
4. Select the first option - `Static site`.
5. Connect your `GitHub` repository containing the source code, by clicking the purple `Connect` button.(I won't cover that here)
6. You will have to provide a `Name`<br>
   If you have a basic website, then everything will stay by default, you just have to give it a name
7. Scroll down and click the purple `Create Static Site` button. Your website will start getting published <br>
   And you will see the live url link that will lead to it.

### That's all. Not very hard, yet extremely useful when you would want to show your projects to anyone in the world, without having to send them your folder with the code.

# BOOTSTRAP

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It enhances the look and feel of your web app. Bootstrap 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap. 


**History**  
It was developed by **Mark Otto** and **Jacob Thornton** at Twitter as a means of improving the consistency of tools used on the site and reducing maintenance. The software was formerly known as Twitter Blueprint and is sometimes referred to as Twitter Bootstrap. It was released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub.


**Responsive Design**   
Responsive design makes it possible for a web page or app to detect the visitor’s screen size and orientation and automatically adapt the display accordingly. The mobile first approach assumes that smartphones, tablets and task-specific mobile apps are employees' primary tools for getting work done.

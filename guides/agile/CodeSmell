Hello

The code smell is important for the development cycle. 

First step, you have to install a plugin to smell your code :
* SonarQube
* Intellij has a code smell in the box
* DECOR
* inFusion
* etc ...

It can be useful for some things such as :
* See the purcentage of your covered code by your units tests.
* See the duplicate code.
* If your class or your method is too big,  the plugin warns you. 
* It verify where are variables that can be null or unused, or wrong block declaration.
* You can do a "hook" on git to verify the purcentage of your coverage. If it bad, you can't push.
* The code is more readable and clean, for open-source projects it's important.

In enterprise, it's an added value to add code smell review in your projects.

I encourage you to adopt code smelling :)

## SDLC

[**SDLC**][1] or **Software Development Life Cycle**  is a methodical approach performed at each step in the software development process. It's a structure followed by a development team of any organization to help increase productivity efficiently while sustaining stability!

## Phases

SDLC model comprises of mainly 6 phases viz.

1. **Analysis** - *gathering requirement from the client, determining project's scope*

2. **Design** - *specifying system requirements, defining overall system architecture*

3. **Implementation** - *writing the code according to design specifications*

4. **Testing** - *fixing bugs, testing various modules, performing [STLC][2]*

5. **Deployment** - *publishing software for customer usage*

6. **Maintenance** - *continuous evaluation of the system in terms of its performance*

## Types

SDLC again has 6 models like so.

1. **Waterfall Model**
2. **V-Shaped Model**
3. **Evolutionary Prototyping Model**
4. **Spiral Method (SDM)**
5. **Iterative and Incremental Method**
6. **Agile development**

## Why implement SDLC?

First of all, let's clarify a misunderstood concept, you simply don't implement SDLC for writing a [hello world][3] program. SDLC is basically a process followed in software projects where each phase generates output required by the next phase in the life cycle. Requirements are translated into design. Code is produced according to the design. Testing should be done on a developed product based on requirement. Deployment should be done once the testing was completed. Once the product is available, it needs maintenance!

## STLC

> [Software Testing][4] is a process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding the software bugs.

**Testing** is one of the significant phase of **SDLC** since it's the last step before deployment of any software. As a result, it has its own dedicated [**Software Testing Life Cycle**][2] (**STLC**) for following proper paradigms in order to rectify buggy codes.

STLC comprises of following phases:

- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test Case Development
- Environment Setup
- Test Execution
- Test Cycle Closure

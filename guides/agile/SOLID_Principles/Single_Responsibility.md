# Single Responsibility Principle

The single responsibility principle (SRP) is the first of the SOLID principles, a set of principles set out to help produce cleaner and more maintainable code.

SRP simply means that any class, module, function... should only handle a single aspect of the program, for example if you have an add function that takes two number and returns the sum of those numbers, you would not expect it to output a file with the result.

Similarly an Employee class shouldn't contain functions related to Warehouse stock as they are unrelated.

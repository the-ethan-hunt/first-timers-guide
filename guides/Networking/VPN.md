## VPN

#### VPN stands for virtual private network

VPN is a word that one might have come across whenever you are blocked by a public network. If you are not allowed to access any website by you network provider, you can still access it using VPN. I am sharing this information jus for knowledge purpose. I do not intend to encourage accessa any  malicious website using this knowledge. Lots of free VPN apps can be found on Google Playstore. 

### How it works

VPN is a machine located in a seperate location. It acts as an a extra door to your request(any web request). Whenever you create a request. Your request is sent to destination and message from the destination is returned back to you. But when you use VPN, all of your requests are transfered to a remote machine/server. This is VPNs server. The task of VPN server is to forward this request to destination and get back the result. This result will then be return back to you machine. 

### How it adds to security

A VPN's client is installed in your machine. This client is responsible for pushing all your requests to VPNs server. This client encrypts all your requests before sending it to server. And server decrypts the requests and continues with its further process. This helps in encrypting all the requests going from you machine. It secures you from any untrusted authority watching you requests in the middle.

### How am I able to access unauthorised Sites?

As we discussed, your request is proxied by VPN server i.e. VPN server makes all request on your behalf. Thus all the restrictions are imposed according to region in which VPN is installed. So you can access unauthorized site only if your VPN server have access to this sites.

### What measures to take.

Nothing is free. VPN Companies are spending so much money for maintaining VPN servers across different regions. Then Why are they giving there services for free? One thing to keep in mind that you are giving VPN clinets access to your all request. Though they may protect you from hackers but what if VPn Company itself is a fraud. Use free services wisely. If you are very concerned then I would suggest to use paid VPN services.

Binary search is the most efficient way to search for an element in a sorted collection.Searching for an element by iterating through a collection of elements, in its worst case may require the system to go through all the collection if the the element we are looking for is last in our collection. Binary search fixes this issue by checking the element in the middle first and comparing it to the element we are searching for. If the middle element matches the element we are looking then we found it, otherwise if the middle element is greater than the element we are looking for we will only have to check the lower half of the collection and if the middle element is less than the element we are searching for we check the upper half of the collection. This method drops half of the collection every time it looks up an element making it the most efficient searching method for a sorted collection, for example if we are looking for a number between 1-100, we will find it in less than 10 trails, unlike the 100 times we might have to check in iterative search.

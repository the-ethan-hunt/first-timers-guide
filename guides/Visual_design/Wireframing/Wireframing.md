# Wireframing 

Wireframing is a process undertaken during the early development stages of a website and/or mobile application and is basically a blueprint, enabling a developer to plan what their creation will look like. It will include all the various content and features the page will have, and this is usually done after the user requirements have been gathered and analyzed.

## Types of Wireframe

### Low-fidelity

These are both quick and easy to create, and can be edited/updated without much issue as they are kept relatively simple and straightforward. This can be done with pen and paper.

### High-fidelity

These are more representative of how the final website/app will look and are more detailed than low-fidelity wireframes. They also allow for interactive functions to be included, such as menu buttons and linking to other pages. There are various tools that can be used to create these, such as Justinmind.

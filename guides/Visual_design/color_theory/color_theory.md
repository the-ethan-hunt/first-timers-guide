# Overview

Color theory is a combination of science and art of color. It explains how humans perceive color, how colors mix, match or clash and various ways in which colors can be classified and used.

# RGB Color Model
This model uses the primary colors red,green and blue in different proportions to create all the necessary colors.When you mix red,green and blue colors to their full extent i.e 100% the resultant color is white and when they are mixed to their lowest degree the resultant color is black. So basically you start with black and as you add lights of various colors you get white. Thus RGB color model is also called as additive color model. Colors are much more vibrant in case of rgb as compared to cmyk.

# CMYK Color Model

 This model uses the colors cyan, magenta, yellow and black in various amounts to create all of the necessary colors. When you mix cyan magenta and yellow to their full extent i.e 100% the resultant color is black thus as you remove or subtract (absorb) various proportions of these colors you get a variety of different colors ,thus CMYK model is also called as subtractive color model .

# HEX CODE 

Colors can also be represented using hexadecimal values also called as hex code.The code starts with a hash sign (#) and is followed by six hex values or three hex value pairs for example #AFD645. You can get hex codes for various colors [here]("https://htmlcolorcodes.com/"). Hex codes are generally used for html pages.

# COLOR WHEEL

A color wheel primarily consists of 6 parts. There are three primary colors red,blue and yellow.Colors formed by mixing primary colors are called secondary colors .

- Red   +   Yellow   = Orange (thus orange goes between red and yellow in the color wheel)
- Blue  +   Yellow   = Green  (thus green goes between blue and yellow in the color wheel)
- Blue  +   Red      = Purple (thus purple goes between blue and red in the color wheel)

Thus each primary color has a secondary color to compliment it and as explained above they are represented across each other on the color wheel.

Colors in the upper part of the wheel are called as warm colors (red,orange,yellow) and can be used to represent sun or fire similarly  colors in the lower part of the wheel are called as cool colors (blue,green,purple) 

warm and cool colors are also used to represent feelings,for example to express anger one can use warm colors and to express sadness one can use cool colors.

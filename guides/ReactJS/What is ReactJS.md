**What is ReactJS?**

ReactJS is a declartive, efficient, and flexible Javascript library for building user interfaces.

React is mentioned in the same breath as other javascript frameworks, but "React vs Angular" doesn't make sense because they are not directly comparable. Angular is complete framework (including view layer), React is not. That is why React is confusing to understand, it is emerging in the ecosystem of complete framework, but it is mostly the view.

React gives you a template language and some function hooks to essentially render HTML. That's all React outputs, HTML. Your bundle of HTML/Javascript called "component," can have their own internal state (such as which tab is selected in tab view), but in the end you just render HTML.

## Introduction

Python is a high level programming language. The term "high level" programming language can be considered something that is close to human language. One other term is "low level" programming language. It can be considered something that is closer to the hardware. So, high level languages are easier to understand than low level languages.

## Applications

Everyone interested in Artificial Intelligence must learn Python, as it is widely used in it. Moreover, it is also used in Natural Language Generation, Machine learning, Neural Networks and many other fields of Computer Science.


## Why Python?

# 1: What is Flask? Why Should You Care?

Flask is a web application framework written in Python, meaning it is a third-party Python library used for developing web applications.

It makes the process of designing a web application simpler. Flask lets us focus on what the users are requesting and what sort of response to give back.
 

You probably heard Django while looking for Flask.Both are web frameworks written in Python.
Django is a full-stack web framework for Python, whereas Flask is a lightweight and extensible Python web framework

# 2: Why Flask?
 Flask is simple and easy to get started with while Django is heavy for building web applications

# 3: Flask Structure
Instead of cramming all your code into one place, Flask helps you organize:
- **(1) logic**
- **(2) design**
- **(3) database into separate files.**

**LOGIC**: ‘main.py’ imports the Flask module, creates a web server, creates an instance of the Flask class — in which you write all your “logical” code structuring your web app.

**DESIGN**: The Flask Framework looks for HTML files in a folder called templates for designs. 

**DATABASE**: Flask does not support databases natively, but there are a number of Flask extensions such as Flask-SQLAlchemy,etc.

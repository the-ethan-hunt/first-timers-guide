## OVERVIEW

A Honeypot is a network connected computer system which is a trap designed to attract various attackers and deviate them from unauthorised access to information systems.Honeypots are designed in order to engage them,deviate them and collect information regarding the attackers.Honeyspots aim at logging all the activities of the attacker in order to track their location and study their behaviour.They are easy to equip but they contain technology risks which includes firewall penetration,broken encryption methods and failures to detect attack against system that are not honeypot systems.

## TYPES OF HONEYPOTS

Honeypots are of two types namely:

- Production Honeypots:

Production Honeypots are used in corporate world in order to collect information about the motives of the intruder and diverting and reducing risk of attacks on overall network.<br>

- Research Honeypots
Research Honeypots are used by non profit organisations for the purpose of researching the motives of hackers.

## TYPES OF HONEYPOT DEPLOYMENTS

* Pure honeypots
* Low-interaction honeypots
* High-interaction honeypots

## SETUP YOUR OWN HONEYPOT:
Upon exploring the world of honeypots we come across a good number of varities which includes Honeyd,kippo and Dionaea.Configuring and installing each of them would be pretty hectic but honeydrive configurs and installs all these honaypots,hence it is discussed below.<br>
HONEYDRIVE:THE HONEYPOT PARADISE
Honeydrive is honeypot paradise.It is a linux distribution which comes with 15 different honeypots preconfigured and a set of more than 30 forensic tools.
1 – Download HoneyDrive [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/honeydrive/).
2 – Double click on the .ova file.
3 – Now your VirtualBox will start and will automatically install the new virtual machine with the pre-built guest additions.
4 – Once the installation process is finished, you will have your HoneyDrive up and running.

Apart from identifying hackers,Honey pot developers are more interested in getting access to minds of hacker which further motivates them build more secure systems.

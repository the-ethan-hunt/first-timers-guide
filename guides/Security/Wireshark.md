# Wireshark

Wireshark is an open-source tool for analyzing data packets, as well as helping to profile network traffic. It is used for many reasons such as troubleshooting, security, education and analysis. Since it can also be used for eavesdropping, you must make sure you have permission from the network administrator to run this software, and if it's to be used in an organization, it should be clearly explained within their privacy policy. From data packets we can find out much information, such as the transmit time, destination, protocol type and source of the traffic.

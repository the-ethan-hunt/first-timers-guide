# Vercel
**[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** with their mission - "To Make Cloud Computing Accessible To Everyone", which allows developers to deploy their web projects with minimal effort and maintenance.
 

## What is Vercel? (The origin ZEIT Now)
**Vercel(ZEIT Now)** is a deployment tool by **Vercel**. Itâ€™s a hands-down seamless way to launch your web applications, docker containers or even static websites to the cloud platform. Moreover, **Vercel** is free (or Pay as you Grow plan) and light use even just for a beginner. 


## Personal Domain
**Vercel** also allows developers to set up their projects to their custom domain (or a free .now.sh suffixed URL) along with free automatic SSL which puts a protective cover to shared encrypted data between the server and browser.


## Zero Config = Serverless
**Vercel** integrate directly with GitHub or GitLab as well. It allows developers to host static websites and web applications that deploy upon every push in branches or merge/pull requests to preview changes live. At the same time, it scales automatically, requires no orchestrate, operate and monitor, all with no configuration to the server. It also provides developers with a GUI(graphical symbols) or command-line(text only), to quickly spin up their projects on **Vercel** platform.

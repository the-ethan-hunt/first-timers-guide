Unreal is a popular 2D and 3D game development engine that offers both free and paid models. It is used in both independent and large scale game development.

## Interface
Unreal has a customizable workspace that allows users to move windows around, although many windows will open externally. The GUI is user friendly and utilizes graphical icons in addition to text to represent core functions. Key features include a live viewport and in game preview with a build.

## Engine
The engine utilizes a node based blueprints system to support game functionality, materials, scripting. To script, C++ is supported however the engine primarily focuses on its node based blueprints script. Additional scripts and assets can be downloaded from the Asset Store, but it is not as rich as Unity. Unreal engine starts with a greater amount of graphical post processing. This makes projects in Unreal look great out of the box, however adding objects or changing light parameters will require a build before running, similar to a coding pipeline.

Asset support is decent in the engine, supporting almost any 3D file format but not .blend files natively. Materials, textures, or animations can be created or modified from within the specific windows also using a node based system. Unreal is a long time supporter of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) so their node based material editor looks great and is similar to other pipelines that use node editors (like Blender). As a result of including high quality graphics in the default engine, Unreal trades barebone customization for AAA graphics.

As of the latest release, Unreal engine supports several platforms but is heavily geared towards PC or powerful consoles.

## Community
For a long time, Unreal was divided into the professional Unreal Engine and the hobbyist Unreal Development Kit. Prior to UDK, Unreal was mostly known for being a proprietary engine that was used to make the Unreal Tournament series. The limited accessibility early on and less lightweight starting point led to a slower growth in users. Popular game releases such as Fortnite, Rocket League, and Batman Arkham series have revitalized independent and small developer interest.

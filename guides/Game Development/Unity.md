Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. First announced only for OS X at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 27 platforms.Six major versions of Unity have been released.

##Interface
Unity has a customizable workspace that allows users to move windows around. The GUI is user friendly and utilizes graphical icons in addition to text to represent core functions. Key features include a live viewport and real time game preview without needing to build the entire project.

##Engine
The engine is based on a drag and drop component system where each object can be fully customized through attributes associated with each component. Custom functions are often supported through script components, which are written in C# or Javascript (documentation can be found on the Unity website). Additional scripts and assets can be downloaded from the well populated Asset Store. Assets can vary from models and animation to full multiplayer frameworks and in game systems. This allows users to customize and rapidly prototype their project from a barebone starting point. 

Asset support is relatively robust in the engine, supporting almost any 3D file format including .blend files, which is especially popular in low budget or independent projects. Materials, textures, or animations can be imported or created from within the editor's file browser. Although scripts can be written in any editor, Visual Studio and Monodevelop are integrated with Unity to be default text editors.

As of the latest release, Unity supports a variety of platforms (most notably mobile) and is known for its ease of cross platform development. 

##Community
Due to being free to use for a long time, Unity has become an extremely common tool for independent or small developers. Unity also has been the engine for several high profile successes such as Cities: Skylines, Kerbal Space Program, and Hearthstone. The large community and ease of access makes it easy to find documentation and tutorials to learn the engine.

## Overview

**The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever** is a logic puzzle created by [Raymond Smullyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan "Raymond Smullyan") and popularized by [George Boolos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boolos "George Boolos"). This puzzle was published in [The Harvard Review of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harvard_Review_of_Philosophy "The Harvard Review of Philosophy") in 1996 & is commonly known as *The Three Gods Riddle*.

## The Puzzle

### Statement :-

> Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for yes and no are da and ja, in some order. You do not know which word means which.

### Clarifications :-

- You may ask three **yes** or **no** questions.
- The Gods will answer either **da** or **ja** to each question.
- In English, **da** or **ja** translates to **yes** or **no** but you do not know which is which!
- Each question must be addressed to only one God.
- You can address multiple questions to the same God.
- You do not need to formulate the three questions simultaneously.
- The response of God **Random** is equivalent to the outcome of the flip of a [fair coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin "fair coin")!

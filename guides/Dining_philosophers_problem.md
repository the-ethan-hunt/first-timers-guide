# Dining philosophers problem

If you've taken a look at the algorithm world it is very likely you've heard about the *dining philosophers problem*.
And if you have not, don't worry I'll explain it briefly here.

## The problem

Take five silent philosophers, sit them around a round table with a bowl of spaghetti in front of them.
Then put a fork between each pair of philosopher. Do you see where this is heading ?

Each of the philosopher must alternatively think and eat. Pretty easy you may say. Yes but the problem comes right now.
A philosopher can eat only when there is a fork in each of his side, so one on the right and one on the left.
A fork can only be held by one philosopher at a time, so if a fork is used by philosopher 1, philosopher 2 can not use it.

#### There you have a **brief** overview of the *dining philospher problem*. You'll obviously find more details about it ont the Internet.

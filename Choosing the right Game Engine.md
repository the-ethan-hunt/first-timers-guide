Choosing the right Game Engine
========================================================
As your first step towards Game Development, it is necessary to choose the right engine that suits you. It could be said that you can take up any engine and start right away, however not all engines have the same features and may or may not fit your system.


----------------------


Know your System
-----------------
Each device has its own capabilities based on architecture and storage space. You can find them enlisted in your device properties. Each of the terms is discussed below...

1. **Architecture:** This means whether you have a *32 bit* or *64 bit* computer. Some engines may only have support for 64 bit computers and not 32 bit, however older versions of the same engine may have support for 32 bit. 
2. **Storage Space:** Some engines occupy more space than others.

Features
-----------------
This refers to what type of games does the engine allow you to make, and for which devices. This could be checked on the engine's respective page or in its communities. Some of the popular  Game Engines and their features have been listed below...

**Unity**
